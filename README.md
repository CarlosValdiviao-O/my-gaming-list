# My Gaming List

This is my most ambitious project so far and I'm pleased with the results. It's a knock-off of https://myanimelist.net/ but for gaming with what I considered the most important features from the page.

Note.- This project grew too big too fast so there are many things I would like to improve upon, but due to time constraints it won't be my main priority for the time being. Beign that said, there is no mobile compatibility due to my poor decision of almost copying the same styling as the original page to make things faster, ending up resorting to bad practices such as giving fixed sizes to most elements compromising resposiveness. 
If you find any other major issue feel free to contact me!
